      <p class="bio">
        Hi! I'm <span class="highlight">Mark Vergara</span>, currently a
        <span class="highlight">4th year student</span> pursuing a BS in Information
        Technology. While my formal education has provided a strong foundation, I'm
        proud to say that the majority of my technical knowledge is self-taught through
        hands-on experience and continuous learning.
      </p>

      <div class="experience">
        <p>
          During my 3rd year of college, I gained valuable experience through a
          <span class="highlight">3-month remote part-time position</span> as a junior
          developer at a company based in Manila. This meant a lot to me as those
          3 months of experience was the first time i was able to work with a team
          and learn from them.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm currently seeking opportunities for my upcoming
          <span class="highlight">Internship (On the Job Training)</span> in early
          2025. I'm excited to apply my skills in a professional setting and continue
          growing as a developer.
